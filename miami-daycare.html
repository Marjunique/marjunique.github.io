            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-4">The Challenge</h3>
            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Miami's Department of Human Services manages daycare programs serving families across the city, but the application process had never been formally researched or documented. With extensive waitlists and a mix of paper and digital processes, families faced unclear barriers to accessing critical childcare services.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed">
                The project goal was to create a comprehensive journey map identifying pain points and opportunities for wraparound services—particularly for English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole-speaking communities.

            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">
                I led a 9-week mixed-methods research engagement, conducting interviews with parents, daycare staff, and administrators to map the entire application journey from discovery to enrollment.

                    <p class="font-medium mb-2">1. Discovery Relies on Word of Mouth</p>
                    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                        Most parents learned about the daycare from friends or by chance—not through city websites or signage. Online information was minimal and facilities were difficult to locate.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-xs font-light text-stone-600 mt-2 italic">
                        "I found the daycare by walking by the library next door. If I was driving, I wouldn't have noticed it."
                    </p>

                <div class="border-l-3 border-stone-900 pl-6">

                    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                        Parents appreciated the application's clarity but were frustrated by repetitive information requests, especially emergency contacts appearing across multiple forms.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-xs font-light text-stone-600 mt-2 italic">
                        "It's frustrating to write the same emergency contact information over and over again. Why can't they just ask once?"

                    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                        Parents with limited English proficiency relied on Google Translate or family members. Translated documents alone weren't sufficient—interpreters were needed for complex processes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-xs font-light text-stone-600 mt-2 italic">
                        "They should have an interpreter at the office to help Haitian Creole speakers. Not just a form in Creole—actual help."

                    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                        Parents had no visibility into their waitlist position, leading to stress and frequent check-in calls. Some waited up to 9 months with no status updates.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-xs font-light text-stone-600 mt-2 italic">
                        "The waitlist is a black hole. I called every month just to make sure they didn't forget about me."
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                        Once called from the waitlist, parents had extremely short deadlines to submit additional paperwork—sometimes just 3 days—risking lost spots if documents weren't ready.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-xs font-light text-stone-600 mt-2 italic">
                        "The turnaround time was so short. They called me on Friday, and I had to submit everything by Monday. It was stressful."

            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The journey map serves as a foundational tool for Miami's Department of Human Services to improve the parent experience and operational efficiency. It will guide ongoing process improvements and prepare the department for future integration of CiviForm, an open-source platform for streamlining public benefits applications.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed">
                By identifying 16+ pain points across the journey and providing actionable recommendations, this research creates a blueprint for making daycare services more accessible to Miami's diverse communities—particularly families facing language and documentation barriers.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-4">Reflection</h3>
            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This project reinforced how critical it is to map the full user journey, not just the "official" touchpoints. Parents' experiences began long before they found the application form—with chance encounters, word-of-mouth recommendations, and searches for invisible facilities.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed">
                The most valuable insight was understanding that language access isn't just about translation—it's about providing human support at every step. Haitian Creole and Spanish-speaking parents needed interpreters who could guide them through the process, not just documents in their language.
