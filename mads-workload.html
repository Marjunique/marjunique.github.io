                What strategies can be implemented to effectively address workload data collection issues and offer actionable recommendations for improvement?

            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed">
                The Master of Applied Data Science (MADS) program at University of Michigan needed to better understand how course workload data was being collected, processed, and used across different departments. The EyesOnYou research team was tasked with investigating the end-to-end process to identify gaps and improve data collection for better course planning and student experience.

                As part of the EyesOnYou Team, I conducted a contextual inquiry to understand MADS' workload data collection process, the Course Operations Team, and their connection to instructors. Our goal was to map the entire workflow and identify where breakdowns occurred.

                    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                        My team and I conducted individual background research on the MADS program structure, course operations, and existing data collection methods. We then collaborated to create a comprehensive interview protocol, testing and refining it for gathering insights from various departments.

                    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                        We conducted 6 interviews with faculty and staff from various departments—including Course Operations, Academic Affairs, and Instructional teams. Following interviews, we were able to understand communication patterns and identify gaps within the process that weren't visible in documentation alone.

                        We used affinity wall building to synthesize our findings and identify patterns across different departments and roles. This revealed systemic issues that weren't obvious from individual interviews but became clear when we looked at the data holistically.

            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mb-8">
                We identified three critical issues affecting the workload data collection process, each contributing to incomplete data and frustrated stakeholders.

                    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                        There was a significant lack of transparency between stakeholders about how workload data was being collected, processed, and used. Different departments had incomplete pictures of the overall process. Course Operations didn't know how Academic Affairs used the data, and instructors had no visibility into what happened after they submitted information.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                        While systems were automated for instructors to submit workload data, there was insufficient follow-up to ensure instructors understood how to use them or had their questions answered. Automated emails went out, but no one checked if instructors actually completed the forms or needed help understanding what was being asked.

                        Different departments used varying terminology for the same concepts, creating confusion and communication barriers in the data collection process. What Course Operations called "workload estimates" was "time investment data" to Academic Affairs and "course hours" to instructors—all referring to the same information.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-4">Reflection</h3>
            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Developing recommendations to improve a data collection process taught me that many factors must be taken into account before drawing conclusions on the problem. What appeared to be a simple data collection issue was actually a complex web of communication gaps, unclear ownership, and misaligned expectations.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed">
                The interview process revealed that interviewing different participants yields different and overlapping insights. It really highlighted the importance of interview questions and how that can impact your ability to retrieve information. Some stakeholders were very forthcoming about problems, while others required more probing to uncover the same issues from a different angle.
