        <h1>Gamifying Mindfulness: Headspace Challenges</h1>
        <p class="hero-description">Leading mixed-methods research to transform challenges from an email-based B2B offering into an integrated in-app gamification system, developing a 3-phase strategy to increase engagement and expand to D2C markets.</p>

            <h2>My Contribution</h2>
            <p>As <strong>Service Design Intern and UX Researcher</strong>, I led research initiatives that informed a comprehensive product strategy for Headspace's challenges feature, working with a cross-functional team of 7 interns.</p>
            
            <ul class="contribution-list">
                <li>Conducted mixed-methods research including survey research (n=30), stakeholder interviews with B2B clients and internal teams, and competitive analysis of gamification approaches in wellness apps</li>
                <li>Synthesized findings into a 3-phase product roadmap prioritizing customization & storytelling, achievement & progression, and community connectedness</li>
                <li>Identified four evidence-based design principles for encouraging challenge participation: psychoeducation, rewards & affirmations, community building, and habit formation</li>
                <li>Collaborated with brand designers to develop "The 3 C's" visual design system (Community, Challenges, Celebration) with custom illustrations and color palette</li>
                <li>Created email templates, in-app UI concepts, push notification strategy, and social media content to support phased rollout</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Project Goal</h2>
            <p>Explore B2B challenges and the current beta test to identify areas of improvement and ways to increase employee engagement. Additionally, identify if Headspace should expand challenges to a D2C offering.</p>

            <h3>Current Challenges</h3>
            <ul class="challenges-list">
                <li>Lack of personalization — challenges were one-size-fits-all, not tailored to individual user needs or preferences</li>
                <li>Social loafing — in group challenges, individuals contributed less effort because they assumed others would pick up the slack</li>
                <li>Lack of seamless in-app integration — challenges were managed via email outside the app, creating friction and reducing engagement</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Intended Outcomes</h3>
            <ul class="outcomes-list">
                <li>Evidence-based strategy for improving challenges based on user research and competitive analysis</li>
                <li>Design system and visual language for challenges that aligns with Headspace brand</li>
                <li>Phased roadmap for scaling challenges from B2B email to in-app D2C experience</li>
                <li>Framework for measuring engagement, retention, and business impact</li>

            <h2>Process & Methods</h2>

            <div class="phase-section">
                <h3>Phase 1: Discovery Research</h3>
                <p><strong>Methods:</strong> Stakeholder interviews, literature review, competitive analysis</p>
                
                <p>Conducted interviews with B2B stakeholders, enterprise admins, engineering teams, and client success managers to understand business needs, technical constraints, and current challenges performance. Reviewed scientific research on gamification, motivation theory, and group dynamics. Mapped competitive landscape from static to dynamic challenges across wellness and care positioning.</p>

                <p class="activities-list"><strong>Key Activities:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interviewed 5+ stakeholders including Gigi Fioravanti (Enterprise Admin), Ryan Routon and Alex Baranov (Engineering), Anne Robertson (Client Success), and B2B Challenges Team</li>
                    <li>Analyzed competitors including Calm, Wellable, InsightTimer, BurnAlong, SuperBetter, and Habitica</li>
                    <li>Reviewed academic research on gamification effectiveness (Nike Run Club study showing XX% engagement increase)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="phase-section">
                <h3>Phase 2: User Research</h3>
                <p><strong>Methods:</strong> Survey research, preference testing</p>

                <p>Conducted "Express Mission: Are you up for a challenge?" survey with 30 Headspace members to understand preferences for team dynamics, motivation factors, incentives, and social aspects of challenges.</p>

                <p class="activities-list"><strong>Key Activities:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Surveyed 30 members on individual vs. group preferences, competition attitudes, and motivating factors</li>
                    <li>Tested preferences for achievements/badges, charitable donations, and leaderboard competition</li>
                    <li>Assessed comfort levels with discussing meditation and mindfulness with others</li>
                    <li>Gathered feedback on potential challenge types (individual goal-based, small group goals, large group collective)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="phase-section">

                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Studies show that gamification increases user engagement when there are elements of customization & meaningful storytelling, achievement & progression, and connectedness with other users working toward common goals.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>User Preferences on Team Dynamics</h3>

            <p><strong>Members prefer working individually when joining a challenge</strong></p>
            <p>When given a choice between individual or group challenges, members prefer working independently to maintain autonomy and avoid social loafing.</p>

            <p><strong>If they have to be part of a team, members prefer working with people familiar to them</strong></p>
            <p>Members prefer teaming up with friends, family, or colleagues they know for challenges rather than being placed in a random group.</p>

            <h3>User Preferences on Motivation & Incentives</h3>

            <p><strong>Achievements/badges and charitable donations are universally motivating</strong></p>
            <p>In both company-wide and Headspace-led challenges, members would be motivated to participate with these incentives.</p>

            <p><strong>Competition was polarizing</strong></p>
            <p>While some members loved the idea of competing and thought it would help them build a habit, some members disliked gamification of mindfulness and meditation.</p>

            <p><strong>Members feel comfortable talking to friends, family, or coworkers about meditation & mindfulness</strong></p>
            <p>Community discussion could be a valuable component to challenges.</p>

            <h3>Design Principles for Encouraging Participation</h3>

            <p>Based on research and literature review, identified four key principles to cultivate intrinsic motivation in challenges:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Highlight Psychoeducation:</strong> Communicate the health benefits of participation to participants</li>
                <li><strong>Rewards and Affirmations:</strong> Include rewards that affirm participants to continue their positive progress</li>

            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>At the end of the internship, research and recommendations were handed off to the B2B Challenges team and Community squad with the following proposed next steps:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Engineering Discovery:</strong> Work with developers to build data infrastructure for in-app challenges, including daily progress updates via Braze</li>
                <li><strong>Fake Door Test:</strong> Validate member interest and preferences for D2C challenges through in-app testing before full development</li>
                <li><strong>Iterative Development:</strong> Launch Phase 1 improvements to B2B challenges (design system, updated emails, engineering POV) while building toward Phase 2 in-app MVP</li>
            </ul>
