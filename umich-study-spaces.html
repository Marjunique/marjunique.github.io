                How can we improve our study space reservation system with searchable/filterable features to make our spaces findable?

            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed">
                The Library Environments UX Research Team and the Library Information Technology Design and Discovery Team collaborated to improve the user experience of the Library's study spaces booking website. Students experienced issues searching and booking studying spaces on the library's booking site, often unable to find spaces that matched their needs for noise level, atmosphere, and amenities.

                I led the usability testing phase of this collaborative research project, conducting tests across multiple university booking systems to understand how students interact with different interface patterns and filter mechanisms.

                    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                        We analyzed booking systems at various universities to compare filter categories, filter functionality, search-ability, atmosphere descriptions, location metadata, and features. We selected University of Cambridge, NYU, UT Austin, and Duke as our databases for usability testing, as they closely matched our design mockups.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                        The UX designer created two mockups of the study space booking website with filter values for "Noise level" and "Atmosphere" as well as views of filter components in use. We tested both vertical and horizontal versions to understand which layout students preferred.

                        I conducted 15 usability tests, carefully optimizing task order and combinations to prevent bias and data manipulation. Tests were conducted across multiple university booking systems to understand how students interact with different interface patterns and what features they found most helpful.

                        We identified key themes and highlighted outliers across all testing sessions. This analysis supported our design decisions for the future reservation booking system and provided clear direction for feature prioritization.

            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mb-8">
                We learned that students want a website that is easy to navigate, yet provides the necessary information to book a suitable study space. Their needs went beyond basic filtering—they wanted context, guidance, and visual confirmation.
            </p>

            <div class="space-y-6">
                <div class="border-l-3 border-stone-900 pl-6">

                    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                        Students emphasized the importance of images and descriptions to understand space characteristics before booking. They wanted to see what the space looked like and understand its atmosphere, not just know its technical specifications.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="border-l-3 border-stone-900 pl-6">

                    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                        Students needed directions and guided instructions throughout the booking process. The current systems assumed familiarity with library spaces and booking procedures that new users didn't have.

                    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                        Students were frustrated when they found spaces that couldn't actually be reserved. They were eager for a feature that would filter out non-reservable spaces from results, saving time and reducing confusion.

                    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                        Indicators for noise levels were highly requested to help students find appropriate study environments. Students noted that noise level was often their primary decision factor when choosing a space.

            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This research process taught me how to apply service design principles to my research strategy. Throughout the process, I learned that centering our users throughout the process aligned the most with our goals.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Usability testing provided significant insight on where users experienced challenges which resulted in me developing more empathy for our users. Watching students struggle with interfaces I thought were intuitive was humbling and reminded me why direct user research is irreplaceable.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed">
                I also learned to adopt flexibility during usability testing. Sometimes you'll encounter users who are short with responses, so you have to adapt and ask questions in different ways to better assist the user and gather meaningful insights.
