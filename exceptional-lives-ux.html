            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Test the Exceptional Lives website taxonomy and foster empathy within the team by encouraging them to experience the site as users would—families navigating special education resources.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed">
                The team didn't understand the mental models users were applying to navigate the website. The site was cluttered with too much information on each page and lacked visual hierarchy, making it confusing for new users to find what they needed.

                As UX Researcher, I designed and facilitated a research process that turned internal team members into users, generating insights and empathy that drove organizational change.

                    <li>• Synthesized insights that informed website redesign and content strategy</li>

                    <p class="font-medium mb-2">1. Survey Development</p>
                    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                        Created scenarios simulating real parent journeys through the website, asking team members to find specific resources as if they were families in need. This prompted them to experience the site without their insider knowledge.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="border-l-3 border-stone-900 pl-6">

                    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                        Distributed the survey using Google Forms to nine team members, giving each 15-20 minutes to complete it independently before the group discussion.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="border-l-3 border-stone-900 pl-6">

                    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                        Led a one-hour group workshop to discuss experiences and findings. This session revealed how the team's internal knowledge had masked usability issues glaringly obvious to new users.
                    </p>

                        Synthesized team insights into actionable recommendations that informed content strategy, website redesign, and ongoing research practices.

                        Information was buried deep in the site structure, requiring multiple clicks to find basic resources.

                    <p class="text-xs font-light text-stone-600 italic">
                        "I found helpful info immediately, and with each click there was more. A LOT... didn't know where to click next, but just chose links that stood out for my personal purposes."

                        The menu prioritized geographic organization over topical searches, misaligning with how parents actually look for help.

                        "We have a very location based focus in the top menu, more than topical for our main resources. I'm not likely to come to the site to look for a medium, I'm coming with a topic/question."

                        The exercise successfully created empathy—team members recognized they had made navigation unnecessarily difficult.
