            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-4">The Challenge</h3>
            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The people deciding how information was presented on Exceptional Lives' website didn't understand the mental models users were trying to use to navigate it. The website's design was cluttered with too much information on each page and an overall lack of visual hierarchy.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed">
                New users found navigating the website confusing, and pages contained long, unformatted text leading to information overload.

            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed">
                Our research aimed to test the taxonomy and foster empathy within the team by encouraging them to put themselves in the shoes of our users—families navigating special education resources.

                <div class="border-l-3 border-stone-900 pl-6">
                    <p class="font-medium mb-2">1. Planning</p>
                    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                        I developed a survey with scenarios and tasks to prompt the team to empathize with users. The scenarios simulated real parent journeys through the website, asking team members to find specific resources as if they were families in need.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="border-l-3 border-stone-900 pl-6">

                    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                        I deployed the survey using Google Forms to our nine team members (CEO, content team, marketing team), giving each of them 15-20 minutes to complete it independently.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="border-l-3 border-stone-900 pl-6">

                    <p class="text-sm font-light leading-relaxed text-stone-700">
                        After the survey, I led a one-hour group workshop to discuss our experiences and findings. This session revealed how the team's internal knowledge had masked usability issues that were glaringly obvious to new users.

                        The menu prioritized geographic organization over topical searches, misaligning with how parents actually look for help.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-4">Reflection</h3>
            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This project taught me that sometimes the most powerful research doesn't require elaborate setups or large sample sizes—it requires creating genuine empathy. By having the team experience the website as users would, we generated insights that were immediately actionable and impossible to ignore.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed">
                The workshop discussion was particularly valuable. Hearing team members articulate their frustrations in real-time created shared understanding and buy-in for change. When the CEO said "Wow, do we ever make it hard for people," it signaled a fundamental shift in how the organization approached user experience.
